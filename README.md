Moondream is a **tiny vision language model capabable of "describing" images.**

This fork aims to:

- Adapt moondream scripts to an specific academic and research use case in the **image-captioning** field.

- NOT work straight-forward, it needs some previous setup, that will be detailed soon.

You will see some **hugging face** scripts, but this fork is done to properly work using the `model.safetensors` and other fine-tuned models that are not available here.
